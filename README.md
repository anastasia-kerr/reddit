# reddit

This is a very basic set up

I didn't want to waste time trying to figure out what reddit token rules are and how to get posts using their API, so created two ifrastructure projects, one's fake one's not finished

This set up assumes that our service is for a specific subreddit, hence the subreddit is part of the app settings

again, to preserve time only one end point is available "getposts"
